# How to run test_data_util.py

The script requires two arguments to parse, the stock ticker and days back.

You must run the script like:
`python3 test_data_util.py AAPL 60`

Or to test with multiple tickers you can pass them as a comma separated list like:
`python3 test_data_util.py "AMD,NVDA,AAPL" 30`

Pictures of the plots will be saved to the test_plots directory.
